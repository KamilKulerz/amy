Hi,

The next election for the Software Carpentry Foundation Steering
Committee [1] is going to be held in February 2016 [2], and to
prepare, we'd like to make sure our records are up to date.  If your
location, email, or location are out of date in the information below,
please update them using:

  https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/update_profile/

Please also check the information about workshops you've been involved
in -- if any details are missing or incorrect, please mail
team@carpentries.org.  And if you have taught any self
organized workshops, we'd like to add them to your records as well, so
please send the date, location, instructors, number of attendees, and
workshop website to the same address.

If you would rather not receive mail from us in future, please mail
team@carpentries.org and we will remove you from our contact
list.

Thanks for all you've done for Software Carpentry - you're the ones
who make what we do possible, and we look forward to continuing
working with you.

Thank you for your application for The Carpentries instructor training.
Due to high demand, the waiting time for open instructor training events
is currently 8-12 months as we try to clear our backlog. If you are affiliated
with one of our institutional partners (listed at
https://carpentries.org/members/), we will do our best to prioritize your
application; if you or your institution would like to discuss partnership, we
would welcome an opportunity to speak with you.

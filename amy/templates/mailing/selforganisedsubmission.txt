Thank you for informing us of your self-organised workshop! The workshop administrative team or your regional coordinator will follow-up within a week.

Approximately 2 weeks prior to the workshop, please send a reminder to your learners to complete the pre-survey and install the necessary software prior to the workshop. Feel free to utilize the email template "Email Learners before Workshop", found in The Carpentries Handbook (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#email-templates). The survey links for learners are automatically generated on the workshop's GitHub page, and typically located above and within the schedule.

If you are planning to teach the workshop online, you can look at resources that will help you get ready in the handbook (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index_online.html).

Have a great workshop!
The Carpentries

Thank you for submitting this issue to AMY.  If this represents an urgent problem such as AMY not loading at all, please contact team@carpentries.org so we can respond promptly.

All other issues will be reviewed on a weekly basis by @maneesha.  She will follow up here with you and/or other team members if more information is needed. Issues will be prioritized, considering whether they fix broken features, enhance existing features, or implement entirely new features.


From there, one of the following will happen:

* High priority issues will be included in an upcoming work cycle and labeled for an existing milestone.
* Medium to low priority issues will be considered for a future workcycle and labeled "later."  These re-reviewed periodically to consider them for an upcoming work cycle. 
* Issues that are stale, redundant, or are otherwise assessed not to positively impact user workflows will be closed and labeled "wont-fix"


Comments in the issue itself will provide further context. Please contact team@carpentries.org with any questions.

# AMY Documentation

AMY is a web-based workshop administration application for The Carpentries and related projects. Its target audience is workshop coordinators, most of whom are non-programmers, who need to keep track of what workshops are being arranged, when they're supposed to occur, who's teaching what, and so on.

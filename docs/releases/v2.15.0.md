# AMY release v2.15.0 - 2020-12-06

Major AMY release [v2.15.0][]. This release contains some big changes, like
"Acknowledge Workshop Request review" manually-triggered emails and documentation
generated and hosted at project's [GitHub page](https://carpentries.github.io/amy/).
The new feature for preselecting options on "Accept & create a new event" forms should
be useful, too.

Many thanks to our contributors, [Kunal][] and [Stephan][], for fixing the accordion
bug, fixing typos and improving our documentation! See below for more details.

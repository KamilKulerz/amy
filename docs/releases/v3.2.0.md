# AMY release v3.2.0 - 2021-07-03

Minor AMY release [v3.2.0][]. This release brings two exciting new features.

First - consents migration - means we can enable consents in the production server.
Second - `Pipenv` tool - means we can install and manage AMY dependencies in a more secure way.
Both features are very exciting.


## New features
* [LB][] migrated old consents to the new ones, which enables the new system in AMY - [#1984](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1984)
* [Piotr][] switched AMY's Software Supply Chain to use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) - [#1965](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1965)

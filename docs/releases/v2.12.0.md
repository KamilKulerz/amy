* [Piotr][] added a collection of upgrades to Email Automation ([#1639](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1639)):
  - "previous", "next" buttons on Preview page
  - RQJob (when created) saves in DB related event's slug and list of related emails
  - RQ Worker (3rd party software) logs were enabled
  - additional log messages added for Django Admin actions regarding RQJobs (like cancel, preview, reschedule, send now, or retry)
  - configuration for [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) was added, and some files were formatted with it
  - "View queue" button was moved from Email Templates to RQJobs (more suitable)
  - Jobs (from RQ library) now update RQJobs (from AMY) status when their (Jobs from RQ library) status changes.
* [Piotr][] updated handling of `contact` `<meta>` tag to support multiple values - also in `Event` models - [#1642](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1642) - as part of this PR some bug were fixed, too
* [Piotr][] added updating template functionality to existing RQJobs. Existing admin endpoints started requiring POST. Some styling was improved, too - [#1645](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1645)

* [Piotr][] solved internal error with Redis container not having permissions to write to `/data` - [#1628](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1628)
* [maneesha][] clarified text for self-organised submission form, so that it doesn't sound like only a certified instructor or member site could submit the form - [#1630](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1630)
* [Piotr][] fixed Instructors Over Time report - [#1632](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1632)

* [Piotr][] updated `social-auth-core` dependency to sustain GitHub log-in functionality - [#1636](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1636)
* [Piotr][] fixed lack of redirection to page specified by `?next=` param in URL after successful GitHub login - [#1643](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1643)
* [Piotr][] fixed HTML errors on Event edit page ([#1642](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/pull/1642) - as part of this PR some new features were introduced, too):
  - multiple comment fields
  - Task and Sponsorship forms had multiple `<form>` tags around them
  - some fields in Task and Sponsorship forms had the same IDs, so both forms were prefixed

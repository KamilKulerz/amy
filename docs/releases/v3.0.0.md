# AMY release v3.0.0 - 2021-05-29

This major AMY release [v3.0.0][] contains three projects:

* new memberships (worked on by [Piotr][])
* new consents (worked on by [LB][])
* profile archival (worked on by [LB][]).

Memberships and profile archival are currently enabled, but consents will be
enabled with v3.1.0 release.

Each of the project contains a lot of features and bugfixes, as they
underwent staging testing on a test server.

Currently, some of the features are still worked on in memberships and
consents projects.
